# SVG-Logo-Generator23 ðŸŽ¨ (v1)

## Description:
The motivation behind this project was to build a working application that generates SVG logos based on your inputs. Rather basic in structure currently, but passing grading requirements. I wish I would've had more time to get into the niddy griddy, it feels like I've only just began to take shape of understanding the utility behind the test files. That being said, this was a very fun assignment and I'm proud of myself. Thanks for checking it out!
